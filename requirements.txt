Features due by 4/30:
 1) A logged-in user can add money to their balance.
 2) A logged-in user can add items to their shopping cart.
 3) A logged-in user with a non-empty cart can "place an order."
 4) Any user can filter the menu by some useful criterion (perhaps food category or keyword?).


Features due by 4/16:
 1) Home page that lists all menu items in some default order.
 2) Item page that describes a menu item in more detail than you see on the home page.
 3) Ability to log in and log out.
 4) Profile page for a logged-in user that shows the user's balance and lists items in the user's shopping cart.

Sample data you'll probably need to demonstrate these features:
- A menu collection (with some menu items)
- A users collection (with a couple of users)
