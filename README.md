# Food ordering web application
Dashboard and RESTfull api for food ordering application concept

## Getting started
As a final project for CS-332 web programming course, we, a group of 3, set out to create web application to demonstrate our understanding of both Front-End and Back-End technologies; we developed a UI and JSON RESTfull API service for food ordering application concept in one month period, including oAuth, user profiles, menu items, comments, and etc.

Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, oAuth

## Process
* Used a template for the front-end Dashboard
* Fixed front end bugs (HTML, CSS, Javascript errors (JQUERY)
* Used AJAX, JSON with jQuery for request data and response processing
* Created endpoints and functionality on the back end for the dashboard and the logic on front end pages to gather and display the data
* Designed NoSQL documents, installed and setup MongoDB in a locally hosted virtual machine.
