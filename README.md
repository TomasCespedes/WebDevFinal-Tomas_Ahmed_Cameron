# Food ordering web application
Dashboard and RESTfull api for food ordering application

## Getting started
To help optimize and improve the efficiency of a Resturant with a high traffic environment; we, a group of 3, developed a UI and JSON RESTfull API service for food ordering application in one month period, including oAuth, user profiles, menu items, comments, and etc.

Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, oAuth

Currently the project is hosted on local machine that requires vpn to access, however its in the process of getting moved to AWS

## Process
* Analyzed traffic and made necessary changes for a better user experience
* Fixed front end bugs (HTML, CSS, Javascript errors (JQUERY)
* Used AJAX, JSON with jQuery for request data and response processing
* Created endpoints and functionality on the back end for the dashboard and the logic on front end pages to gather and display the data
* Designed NoSQL documents, installed and setup MongoDB in a locally hosted virtual machine
* Troubleshooted issues affecting production, stage, and development environments as requested
* Used Terminal for debugging and connecting to remote files in server securely using SSH Encryption (public key and private key)
